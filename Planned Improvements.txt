Implement better copying system for GameMap and LevelEditor
	Consider changing how one considers size of map (do mandatory edge wall count?)
Make sure 0 reward never matters
Dropdown to choose map
Level editor
New, more interesting maps
Copy Minds
Checkpoints in map
Model that uses past move or two to decide
	Make sure it knows whether it's hit a wall
Model with understanding of position
Model with understanding of current and surrounding squares
Model that can stay
	To help build towards Labyrinth AI
	To demonstrate wireheading
	Include in constructors allowed move
Better info display system
	Change toString to use scientific notation
Pure punishment
Document properly
	Comments
	Modularity
	Fix strings in map (don't be lazy)
	Make softReset public and remove from reward
	Different classes for menu and game
	Redo checkMenu() in ReinforcementLearner to only reset if an actual change was occurred
Metric for success of different agents
	Expected value of model
	Time to reach optimal model
Handle overflows in RP2
Find interesting seeds
Pillbug demonstration
	Give orientation
	Make boxes so small as to appear continuous
	Maybe actually make continuous
Add reset for all agents
Make menu look better
Ecosystem? See notebook
Multiple agents?
Multiple starts? Disorientation, prevent memorization
