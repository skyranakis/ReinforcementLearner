Changing the Start location doesn't make the other square normal, but startPosition does indeed change
Fixed 1/15/2019
I had tried to use changeType() to change the old start to normal, but that method doesn't let one overwrite start.
I just fixed it by changing the old start to normal manually in changeType()
